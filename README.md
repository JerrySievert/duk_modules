A set of modules to enable Dukluv to act like Node.js.

Very basic support at the moment.  It bootstraps, and basic modules work.  Currently works on Unix/Linux/OSX.

## Installing

```
$ make install
```

## Using

Dropping into the `repl`:

```
$ dl
```

Using like Node.js:

```
$ dl index.js
```
